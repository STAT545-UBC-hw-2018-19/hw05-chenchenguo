# Homework 5: Factor and figure management
This is the repo for hw05-chenchenguo.
The aim of hw-05 is to reinforce the use of data file loading and arranging.
Specifically:
  * Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures
  * Write some data to file and load it back into R
  * Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics
  * Make a plotly visual
  * Implement visulization design principles

One problem is the ploy_ly() and ggplotly() function can not be fully displayed in markdown file. 
You can check them in .Rmd file. And I inserted a catalog in md file. Once you scroll down to ggplotly, you can scroll back to catalog and click next part.
Thank you.
